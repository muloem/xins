CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.93:

* XINS/Java Commons Library:
  - Added logging of expired entries in class ExpiryFolder.
  - Fixed 4 bugs in class Doorman.
  - Improved logging in class Doorman.
  - Allowing strict thread synchronization checking to be enabled or disabled
    in class Doorman. If disabled, some checks will result in a warning being
    logged instead of an exception being thrown.
  - Made class org.xins.util.text.DateConverter Java 1.3-compliant.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed API class so it runs under Java 1.3. Needs Java 1.4+ to compile,
    though.
  - Fixed queue time-out for the collection of sessions to 5 seconds.

* This release must still be compiled with Java 1.4+, but at runtime this
  release is compatible with Java 1.3+.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.92:

* Improved stability of Doorman.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.91:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - More output from _GetStatistics:
    . number of available processors
    . free heap memory, see:
    . total allocated heap memory
    . maximum heap memory
  - Improved logging output and exception messages in class Doorman.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.90:

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Doorman: Fixed bug. Improved logging.
  - ExpiryFolder: Improved stability in case of out-of-memory errors.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.89:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Added 'startup' attribute to 'initialization' tag in output of function
    _GetSettings.
  - Function _GetStatistics returns "N/A" instead of "NA" if certain
    information is not available.
  - Function _GetSettings no longer returnes the startup time. That is now
    returned from _GetStatistics.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Added DateConverter that produces a human-readable date.

* Printing time stamps in format 'yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm:ss.SS' everywhere. Not
  displaying milliseconds since Epoch anymore. This applies to _GetStatistics
  and to the build time returned by _GetSettings.

* This release must be compiled with Java 1.4+.

* At runtime this release is compatible with Java 1.4+ only.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.88:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed the class description for MissingSessionIDException and
    UnknownSessionIDException.
  - Expecting Log4J config file to be specified in property
    'org.apache.log4j.config'.
  - Replacement strings should now be between square brackets ('[' and ']')
    instead of curly ones ('{' and '}').
  - Added a default function _NoOp that does nothing but return
    <result success="true" />.
  - Function _GetSettings no longer returns a <build /> section, since all the
    properties are already in the <initialization /> section.
  - Fixed bug in logging of deployment ID.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.87:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Changes to function _GetSettings:
    - All properties are returned as a <property /> elements.
    - New section <build /> added, containing deployment identifier, build
      host and build time stamp.
    - Renamed section <init-settings /> to <initialization />.
    - Renamed section <system-properties /> to <runtime />.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.86:

* Added support for _xslt parameter. When specified, the returned XML will
  contain a processing instruction in the form:

     <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="{URL}"?>

  in browsers like Internet Explorer and Mozilla this will result in the
  specified XSLT to be applied to the result XML, client-side. Note that the
  appropriate Security settings need to be applied if the XSLT is from a
  different source than the source XML.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed bug in CallContext.fail(ResultCode).
  - Added CallContext.fail(ResultCode,String). The seconds parameter is the
    message to include in the output.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.85:

* Improved the automatic release process. Introduced .version.properties.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.84:

  api/impl-java.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.83:

* Generated CAPI classes:
  - Fixed bug. All generated function calling methods now correctly check
    result.isSuccess(). If it returns false, then an UnsuccessfulCallException
    is thrown.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.82:

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Added class Replacer to package org.xins.util.text.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Supporting replacements in servlet initialization settings.

    PropertyConfigurator.configureAndWatch().

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.81:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Class APIServlet: Improved logging and applied some small improvements.
  - Function _GetSettings now returns system properties as well, not just the
    initialization settings.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.80:

* Fix minor typo in Javadoc comment (class FunctionCallerParser).

* Simplified and improved logging in class APIServlet.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.79:

* Shell script 'xins' has been improved. These changes have not been applied
  to xins.bat (yet):
  - support added for -deployment option
  - supports for -bypass option that disables the regeneration of the Ant
    buildfile. The buildfile must already exist.

* Shell script 'xins' now distinguishes between SystemV and BSD systems. Based
  on this, either 'echo -n "text"' or 'echo "text" \c' is used when no newline
  should be output.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Logging deployment ID if any was specified at build time.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.78:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:

* Generated web.xml file now has indentation enabled.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.76:

* Supporting the attribute 'mapping' in the impl-java tag in the api.xml file.
  This results in a custom url-pattern being set in the generated web.xml
  file.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.75:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Displaying XINS version when initializing.
  - Session-based methods now check if the API is really session-based. If it
    is not, then they throw an IllegalStateException.
  - A warning is logged if APIServlet has to initialize Log4J without
    initialization settings.

* Upgraded xmlenc from 0.34 to 0.36.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.74:

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Added class BooleanConstants.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Added class SessionIDSplitter.
  - Added method getActualFunctionCallers() to interface
    CompositeFunctionCaller and to CallTargetGroup (which implements that
    interface.)
  - Added method getActualFunctionCallerByCRC32(String) to interface
    FunctionCaller and to classes CallTargetGroup and ActualFunctionCaller.

* Generated CAPI classes now support sticky sessions, based on splitting
  client session ID in identifier for target API and server-side session
  identifier.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.73:

* Resolved some Checkstyle warnings.

* Generated Javadoc API documentation for XINS projects can no longer link to
  -dev versions of XINS. When determining the version of the online XINS API
  documentation to link to, the -dev part is removed.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Renamed class org.xins.util.LongUtils to org.xins.util.text.HexConverter.
    Extended functionality of HexConverter to support converting ints to hex
    strings.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Small performance improvements by switching to using FastStringBuffer in
    some occasions (instead of the String append operator +).

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - CallResult now has a link to an optional ActualFunctionCaller instead of a
    FunctionCaller. This could theoretically break existing code.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.72:

* Format of api.xml: Added boolean attribute 'shared-sessions' to
  'session-based' tag. Default value is 'false'.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Added getActualFunctionCaller(long) to class CallTargetGroup that
    retrieves an ActualFunctionCaller by CRC-32 checksum of its URL.
  - Added class NonSharedSession.

* Generated CAPI classes:
  - Returning NonSharedSession from functions that create a session within
    APIs that do not have 'shared-sessions' set to 'true'.

* Small Javadoc improvements.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.71:

* Added missing Javadoc comments for some private members.

* Configuration of time-out duration and precision is now done in api.xml.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - No longer allowing initial queue size to be set for ExpiryFolder. This is
    overkill.
  - ExpiryStrategy class now logs a debug message at construction.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - API class now gets and interprets session time-out duration and precision.
  - Maximum queue wait time (for the ExpiryFolder containing the sessions) is
    automatically set to half of the session time-out duration.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.70:

* Added session-based tag to api.xml. Needs to be set for session-based APIs.
  A session-based API is defined as an API that contains at least one
  session-based function.
  The specification documentation now marks session-based APIs and functions.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.69:

* Fixed 22 Checkstyle warnings.

* Fixed bug in output of _GetStatistics that caused total unsuccessful
  duration to be displayed as last unsuccessful duration.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.61:

* Improved generated CAPI classes. This includes a fix for unsuccessful call
  results. These now actually cause an UnsuccessfulCallException.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Synchronizing on sessions so a single session cannot be used in 2
    functions in parallel.
  - Improved logging.

* Fixed bug in XSLT for generating CAPI classes.

* Improved output with result code MissingParameters.
  Instead of outputting the following (pre-0.61):

     <result success="false" code="MissingParameters" />

  the output would now be, for example:

     <result success="false" code="MissingParameters">
        <data>
           <missing-param name="account"/>
           <missing-param name="password"/>
        </data>
     </result>

* Improved output with result code InvalidParameters.
  Instead of outputting for example the following (pre-0.61):

     <result success="false" code="InvalidParameters" />

  the output would now be, for example:

     <result success="false" code="InvalidParameters">
        <data>
           <invalid-value-for-type param="password" type="password"/>
        </data>
     </result>

  has the following format: xxxx:yyyy, where xxxx is a 16-digit hex string
  representing the startup time of the API, and yyyy is a 16-digit hex string
  representing a counter. Example value: "000000f622238ca6:0000000000000000".

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.56:

* Slightly improved logging in XINS/Java Server Framework:

    not init(Properties) method, this will be logged and ignored.
  - Performing deinitialization at shutdown using a destroy() method in the
    instances registered with an API.
  - Duplicate attributes per element are now checked.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.50:

  are now detected and properly cause a failure.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.49:

* Fixed bug in link to pattern test form (for pattern types).

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.48:

* Hid some of the protected interface of CallTargetGroup, because only classes
  in the same package can derive from this class.

* Fixed bug in statistics output, produced by function _GetStatistics.
  Previously the output was like this (incorrect):

     <function name="Login">
        <successful count="1" average="351">
           <min start="351" duration="351"/>
           <max start="1056118455354" duration="351"/>
           <last start="1056118455354" duration="351"/>
        </successful>
        <unsuccessful count="1" average="6">
           <min duration="6"/>
           <max duration="6"/>
           <last start="1056119178887" duration="6"/>
        </unsuccessful>
     </function>

  Now the output will be like this (correct):

     <function name="Login">
        <successful count="1" average="351">
           <min start="1056118455354" duration="351"/>
           <max start="1056118455354" duration="351"/>
           <last start="1056118455354" duration="351"/>
        </successful>
        <unsuccessful count="1" average="6">
           <min start="1056119178887" duration="6"/>
           <max start="1056119178887" duration="6"/>
           <last start="1056119178887" duration="6"/>
        </unsuccessful>
     </function>

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.47:

* Added 'Caller' demo program. Use target 'demo-caller' to execute it, specify
* the request file and the config file, for example:

     $ ant demo-caller -Drequest=request.xml -Dconfig=config.xml

  with config.xml for example as follows:

     <group type="ordered">
        <group type="random">
           <api url="http://127.0.0.1:22/"    />
           <api url="http://127.0.0.1:80/"    />
           <api url="http://127.0.0.1:30002/api" />
        </group>
        <group type="random">
           <api url="http://localhost:30004/api" />
           <api url="http://localhost:30005/api" />
        </group>
     </group>

  and request.xml for example as follows:

     <request function="_GetFunctionList" />

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Introduced CallRequest and CallRequestParser.
  - Changed FunctionCaller interface to accept a CallRequest.
  - Implementated RandomCallTargetGroup and OrderedCallTargetGroup.
  - Removed RoundRobinCallTargetGroup, it is not used.

CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.46:

* Added first (limited) set of unit tests.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.45:

* XINS/Java Client Framework: Introduced FunctionCallerParser that parses an
  XML configuration document that defines CallTargetGroups and
  ActualFunctionCallers. An example of such a configuration is:

      <group type="ordered">
         <group type="round robin">
            <api url="http://apihost0.company.com:2087/auth.pl" />
            <api url="http://apihost1.company.com:2087/auth.pl" />
         </group>
         <api url="http://ext-apihost1.company.com:2088/auth.pl" />
      </group>

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.44:

* Major change to the way ActualFunctionCaller works: DNS lookups are now
  performed at construction time. No longer are DNS names accepted that
  resolve to multiple IP addresses. Use CallTargetGroups for this.

* Fixed problem in specdocs/type_to_html.xslt. It used the template
  'urlencode' without including urlencode.xslt.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.43:

* AbstractCompositeFunctionCaller now actually implements
  CompositeFunctionCaller. This fixes a bug in CallTargetGroup, method
  getActualCallTarget(String).

* Added RandomCallTargetGroup and RoundRobinCallTargetGroup classes (no-op).

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.42:

(none)

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.41:

* Fixed the 'xins' shell script to work on non-FreeBSD operating systems. Only
  using 'mktemp' on FreeBSD, using an unsafer method of creating temporary
  files on other unices.

* Slightly improved 'javadoc' target in XINS build file

* Extended XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Added support for sessions.
  - Renamed class RemoteAPI to ActualFunctionCaller. Deprecated RemoteAPI.
  - Added class AbstractFunctionCaller.
  - ActualFunctionCaller now extends AbstractFunctionCaller.
  - Added class AbstractCompositeFunctionCaller (extends
    AbstractFunctionCaller).
  - Added class CallTargetGroup (extends AbstractCompositeFunctionCaller).

* Improved performance of HTTPRequester (used by RemoteAPI /
  ActualFunctionCaller) by switching to using an unsynchronized
  FastStringBuffer instead of the normal synchronized StringBuffer.

* Improved performance of MandatoryArgumentChecker by letting
  MissingArgumentException use FastStringBuffer instead of StringBuffer.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 0.40:

* Properly encoding plus characters ('+') while URL encoding the link to the
  test form for a type.

* Storing (un)successful min/maximum start timestamp and displaying it in the
  result of _GetStatistics. In the old situation, the output was similar to
  this:

      <data>
         <function name="MyFunction">
            <successful count="124" average="132" min="13" max="830">
               <last start="1055333674847" duration="196" />
            </successful>
            <unsuccessful count="9" average="244" min="94" max="340">
               <last start="1055333620172" duration="250" />
            </successful>
         </function>
      </data>

  In the new situation the output is similar to this:

      <data>
         <function name="MyFunction">
            <successful count="124" average="132">
               <min start="1055332820374" duration="13" />
               <max start="1055330282035" duration="830" />
               <last start="1055333674847" duration="196" />
            </successful>
            <unsuccessful count="9" average="244">
               <min start="1055200307218" duration="94" />
               <max start="1055231843442" duration="340">
               <last start="1055333620172" duration="250" />
            </successful>
         </function>
      </data>
