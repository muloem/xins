List of things to be done for XINS release 1.0:

- Create a branch called BRANCH_1_0_x
- First tag on the BRANCH_1_0_x branch should be RELEASE_1_0_0
- Start with empty CHANGES file
- Make sure empty directories are not included in the new branch
- Remove unused methods, fields and classes
- Finalize log entry ID's.
- Prepare the annoucement (text + web sites where it will be posted)
- Set @since tags on all classes to 1.0 (should we really do this?)
- Extend unit tests
