*** INTRODUCTION ***

This is a release candidate. It is expected to be stable and will not
undergo any major changes.

This release is considered fully compatible with all previous stable releases.
An exception is logging; log messages can change between individual releases.


*** PREREQUISITES ***

The following are prerequisites for using the XINS framework:
- Apache Ant: 1.6.2 or higher (1.6.5 recommended)
- Java SDK:   1.3.1 or higher (1.4.2 recommended)


*** COMPATIBILITY ***

Binary backwards compatibility of the JAR files (logdoc.jar, xins-common.jar,
xins-client.jar and xins-server.jar) with XINS 1.2.5 has been validated using
Japitools.

Also, compatibility with XINS 1.0 has been improved. In XINS 1.1.0, some
public methods were removed from the XINS/Java Server Framework. These have
been re-added and marked as deprecated. Again, Japitools was used for
validation.

For more information on Japitools, see:

   http://www.kaffe.org/~stuart/japi/

This release has been tested successfully in combination with Apache Ant
version 1.6.5 on different operating systems, including Solaris 8, Linux 2.6,
Windows ME, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

Most likely, it will also work correctly with earlier versions of Ant.

The 'xins' shell script in this release has been tested with bash 2.0x on
Linux 2.6/x86, Solaris 8 and Cygwin 1.5.12 (on Windows 2000).

The 'xins.bat' batch file has been tested with Windows ME, Windows 2000 and
Windows XP.

All 268 unit tests for this release have been executed on the following
platforms, with the indicated results:

Notes:

[1] The HTTPS test failed on various older 1.4.x JDKs (Blackdown 1.4.1_01 and
    Sun 1.4.0_04 on Linux 2.6/x86 and Sun 1.4.1_02 on Solaris 8/SPARC). The
    Sun SSL code reported it was unable to find a trusted certificate.
    Apparently the SSL certificates shipped with these releases are outdated.
    This is unrelated to XINS.

[2] a. HTTPS does not work on Java 1.3. It may work if an appropriate library
       is installed, but this has not been tested.
    b. Also, on Java 1.3 the names of the calling class and method cannot be
       determined automatically. Consequently the logProgrammingError(String)
       method in class org.xins.common.Utils will log the "<unknown>" instead
       of the actual class- and method names.
    c. Finally, Java 1.3 does not come with a compatible XSLT library.
       Consequently, the XSLT calling convention does not work. It may work if
       an appropriate library (e.g. Saxon or Xalan) is installed. However,
       this has not been tested.

[3] Message 'Warning: Could not get charToByteConverterClass!' was
    displayed while executing the task 'specdocs-allinone', after the message
    'Loading stylesheet src/xslt/specdocs/api_to_html.xslt'.

[4] The Blackdown JDK 1.3.1-02b-FCS hung while running the unit tests, after
    outputting the following message:

    /shared/home/ernst/blackdown-jdk1.3.1/bin/i386/native_threads/java:
    relocation error:
    /shared/home/ernst/blackdown-jdk1.3.1/jre/lib/i386/libjava.so: symbol
    __libc_waitpid, version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in file libc.so.6 with link
    time reference

[5] On Windows ME, the ExpiryFolder tests repeatedly fail, along with the
    HTTPS tests. The HTTPS test failures may be related to the old JDK version
    (1.4.2_01).
