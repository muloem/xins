*** INTRODUCTION ***

This is a release candidate. It is expected to be stable and should not
undergo any major changes.

This release should be compatible with previous stable releases.


*** PREREQUISITES ***

The following are prerequisites for using the XINS framework:
- Apache Ant: 1.6.2 or higher (1.6.5 recommended)
- Java SDK:   1.3.1 or higher (1.4.2 recommended)


*** COMPATIBILITY ***

Binary backwards compatibility of the JAR files (logdoc.jar, xins-common.jar,
xins-client.jar and xins-server.jar) with XINS 1.2.5 has been validated using
Japitools.

Also, compatibility with XINS 1.0 has been improved. In XINS 1.1.0, some
public methods were removed from the XINS/Java Server Framework. These have
been re-added and marked as deprecated. Again, Japitools was used for
validation.

For more information on Japitools, see:

This release has been tested successfully in combination with Apache Ant
version 1.6.5 on different operating systems, including Solaris 8, Linux 2.6,
Windows ME, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

Most likely, it will also work correctly with earlier versions of Ant.

The 'xins' shell script in this release has been tested with bash 2.0x on
Linux 2.4/x86, Linux 2.6/x86, Mac OS/X, Solaris 8 and Cygwin 1.5.12 (on
Windows 2000).

The 'xins.bat' batch file has been tested with various Windows versions,
including Windows ME, 2000 and XP.
