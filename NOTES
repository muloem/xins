*** INTRODUCTION ***

This is a release candidate release. It is expected to be stable and will not
undergo any major changes.

This release is considered fully compatible with all previous stable releases.
An exception is logging; log messages can change between individual releases.

*** PREREQUISITES ***

The following are prerequisites for using the XINS framework:
- Apache Ant: 1.6.2 or higher (1.6.5 recommended)
- Java SDK:   1.3.1 or higher (1.4.2 recommended)

*** COMPATIBILITY ***

Binary backwards compatibility of the JAR files (logdoc.jar, xins-common.jar,
xins-client.jar and xins-server.jar) with XINS 1.3.0 has been validated using
Japitools.

The 'xins' shell script in this release has been tested with bash 2.0x on
Linux 2.6/x86, Solaris 8 and Cygwin 1.5.12 (on Windows 2000).

The 'xins.bat' batch file has been tested with Windows ME, Windows 2000 and
Windows XP.

XINS 1.4.0 is based on XINS 1.3.0 which has been tested on a lot of different
configuration. For the list of configuration go to

XINS 1.4.0 has also be tested with the following configurations:

All 309 unit tests for this release have been executed on the following

  - IBM       JDK 1.4.2 SR 3:   OK
  - IBM       JDK 1.5.0 beta:   OK
  - JRockit   JDK 1.5.0_03:     OK

- On Linux 2.6/PPC:
  - IBM JDK 1.4.2 SR 1a:        OK

- On Microsoft Windows 2000:
  - Sun JDK 1.3.1_05:           Some tests failed; see note [1]
  - Sun JDK 1.4.1_07:           OK
  - Sun JDK 1.4.2_10:           OK
  - Sun JDK 1.5.0_04:           OK
  - Sun JDK 1.6.0 EA b69:       OK
  - Sun JDK 1.6.0-beta2-b79:    OK

- On Microsoft Windows XP:
  - Sun JDK 1.4.1_07:           OK
  - Sun JDK 1.4.2_07:           OK
  - Sun JDK 1.5.0_05:           OK

- On Microsoft Windows ME:
  - The installer and the allinone demo has been tested using Java 1.4.2.

[1] a. HTTPS does not work on Java 1.3. It may work if an appropriate library
       is installed, but this has not been tested.
    b. Also, on Java 1.3 the names of the calling class and method cannot be
       determined automatically. Consequently the logProgrammingError(String)
       method in class org.xins.common.Utils will log the "<unknown>" instead
       of the actual class- and method names.
    c. Finally, Java 1.3 does not come with a compatible XSLT library.
       Consequently, the XSLT calling convention does not work. It may work if
       an appropriate library (e.g. Saxon or Xalan) is installed. However,
       this has not been tested.
